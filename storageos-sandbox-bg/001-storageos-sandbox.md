This is a fully configured three node environment so you can try StorageOS in a safe, sandboxed environment.

Start terminals for the second and third host:
`ssh root@host02`{{execute T2}}
`ssh root@host03`{{execute T3}}

Once `storageos node ls`{{execute}} reports all nodes are healthy, check out the [StorageOS documentation](docs.storageos.com) for what you can do.
