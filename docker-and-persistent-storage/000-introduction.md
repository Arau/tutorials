Linux container technology solves many critical challenges, bridging the Dev/Ops divide and helping organizations bring quality applications to production more rapidly than ever before.

As container technology approaches mainstream adoption, however, administrators will expect to see many of the enterprise features available in virtualized environments. **Persistent storage is key among these requirements.** While containers do a great job of encapsulating application logic, they do not offer a viable solution for storing application data across the lifecycle of the container. Ephemeral (or local) storage is not enough, and stateful applications require that container data be available beyond the life of the container that houses them.
