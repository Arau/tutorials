Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. A data volume is a directory or file in the Docker hostâ€™s filesystem that is mounted directly into a container.

Try the following commands:

`docker volume create my-vol`{{execute}}
`docker volume ls`{{execute}}
`docker volume inspect my-vol`{{execute}}
`docker volume rm my-vol`{{execute}}

The volumes themselves are stored on the host under `/var/lib/docker`.

`sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes`{{execute}}
