### Content guidelines

Each scenario should be self contained, without dependencies on other tutorials.
Favour short, readable, full English sentences over dense, verbose text.

### Testing changes

The best way to test scenarios is to create your own Katacoda account and link it to your Github fork. Once you're happy with the fork, pull request to upstream and once merge Katacoda will automatically update.
