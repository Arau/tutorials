## Step 5: Volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
* You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
* Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
* Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
* A new volume’s contents can be pre-populated by a container.

In addition, volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, because using a volume does not increase the size of containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.


`docker volume create my-vol`{{execute}}
`docker volume ls`{{execute}}
`docker volume inspect my-vol`{{execute}}
`docker volume rm my-vol`{{execute}}

### Start a container with a volume
`
docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  --mount source=myvol2,target=/data \
  busybox sh
`{{execute}}

docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name tmptest \
  --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/app \
  busybox sh
