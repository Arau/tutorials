Modern web-scale applications are expected to be horizontally scalable, resilient, automatable and platform agnostic. Such cloud native architectures present distinct challenges for persistent storage:

* Specialized storage servers are difficult to scale, due to being a single point of failure.
* Mapping containers to specific hosts (for data) is undesirable, as containers are expected to be portable and lightweight across hosts.
* Storage needs to tightly integrate with containers and orchestration platforms, with APIs to minimize operator overhead.
